### Tensorflow implementation of V-Net
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the [V-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797) architecture used for 3D medical imaging segmentation. This code adopts the tensorflow graph from https://github.com/MiguelMonteiro/VNet-Tensorflow. The whole code covers training, evaluation and prediction modules for a 3D medical image segmentation.
